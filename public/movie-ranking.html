<h1>The Best Movies According to Avinash</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One Piece Film: Red</h3>
<p>The movie has some of the best animation One Piece has seen, especially during key action scenes and musical performances.</p>
<h3>Edge of Tomorrow (2014) </h3>
<p>The "Live. Die. Repeat." mechanic is executed brilliantly, making every reset feel intense and strategic rather than repetitive</p>
<h3>Lucy (2014)</h3>
<p>he movie explores human potential, intelligence, and existence in a unique way.</p>
